# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to provide the organization with insight into which (an how many) employees will be eligible to retire soon, which departments should be preparing to replace retiring employees, and which employees will be eligible for the proposed "mentorship program" to ease the transition.
## Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables.
- 90,398 employees are nearing retirement age (per the Unique Titles table)
- Senior Engineers and Senior Staff account for approximately 60% of employees nearing retirement (29,414 and 28,254 employees respectively).
- 1,549 employees meet the requirements listed to be eligible for the mentorship program.
- Only 1.7% of the soon-to-retire employees are eligible to participate in the proposed mentorship program.

## Summary: 
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 
  - There are 90,398 employees reaching retirement age  
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
  - There are 1549 employees who meet the given criteria for the mentorship program. If there are about 90,000 roles to be filled, that creates an approximate ratio of 60 mentees per eligible mentor (assuming that all eligible mentors take advantage of the mentorship program opportunity). It may lessen the blow of training so many new-hires, but there will not be enough mentors to serve all new-hires.
- The Development and Production departments have the greatest number of soon-to-retire employees (accounting for approximate half of the total number of retirement eligible employees. Thus, Developement and Production will require the greatest assistance in hiring and training new employees over the next few years. (see table below)

- The average salary of the employees retiring soon broken down by title may prove useful when determining hiring budgets over the new few years. The breakdown is as follows in the image below.
